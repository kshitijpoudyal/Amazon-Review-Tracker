# Firebase Integration Guide

## 🎉 Your data has been successfully uploaded to Firebase!

Your Amazon Review Dashboard now supports both local storage and Firebase cloud storage. The Firebase integration provides persistent, cloud-based storage that can be accessed from anywhere.

## 🔧 Setup Complete

### ✅ What's been configured:
- Firebase project: `productreview-52e51`
- Service account authentication
- Firestore database with your product data
- Frontend Firebase integration
- Automatic backups

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. **Toggle Storage Mode**
In the app header, you'll see a toggle switch:
- **Local Storage**: Changes stored in browser only
- **Firebase (Cloud)**: Changes saved to cloud database

### 2. **Firebase Mode Features**
When Firebase mode is enabled:
- ✅ **Cloud Storage**: Data persists across devices and browsers
- ✅ **Auto Backup**: Creates backup before each save
- ✅ **Real-time Sync**: Changes are saved to Firestore
- ✅ **Refresh**: Pull latest data from Firebase

### 3. **Firebase Operations**
- **Save to Firebase**: Click to save local changes to cloud
- **Refresh**: Pull latest data from Firebase
- **Reset Changes**: Discard local changes, keep Firebase data

## 📊 Firebase Console Access

**Your Firebase Project URLs:**
- **Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/productreview-52e51
- **Firestore**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/productreview-52e51/firestore

## 🗂️ Data Structure in Firestore

### Collections:
1. **`products`** - Individual product documents
   ```
   product_0, product_1, product_2, ...
   ```

2. **`dashboard`** - Summary information
   ```
   summary: { totalPaid, totalReceived, netDelta, lastUpdated }
   ```

3. **`backups`** - Automatic backups with timestamps
   ```
   backup_2025-08-11T...: { data, createdAt, source }
   ```

## 🛠️ Available Commands

```bash
# Upload current JSON data to Firebase
npm run upload-to-firebase

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# View Firebase console
open https://console.firebase.google.com/project/productreview-52e51
```

## 🔄 Workflow

### **Recommended Usage:**
1. **Enable Firebase mode** in the app header
2. **Make changes** (edit, add, void products)
3. **Save to Firebase** using the purple "Save to Firebase" button
4. **Data is now persisted** in the cloud and backed up

### **For Multiple Users:**
- Each user can enable Firebase mode
- Changes are saved to the same cloud database
- Use "Refresh" to get latest changes from other users

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Service account key is stored locally (`firebase-service-account.json`)
- For production, move this to environment variables
- Consider implementing user authentication for multi-user access

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **Firebase Connection Issues:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify Firebase project is active in console
3. Switch to Local Storage mode as fallback

### **Data Sync Issues:**
1. Click "Refresh" to pull latest data
2. Check Firebase console for data integrity
3. Use backups in Firestore if needed

## 🎯 Next Steps

2. **Make some changes** and save to Firebase
3. **Check the Firebase console** to see your data
4. **Try refreshing** from another browser/device
